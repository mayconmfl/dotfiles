## Installation

**Warnings**: 

- This is a dotfiles mvp version designated for macOS only, but if you want, can extract zsh settings.

- If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.

 

### Using Git and the install script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/dev/mysdk/projects/dotfiles`, with `dotfiles` as a symlink.) The install script will do the work copying the files to your home folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mayconmfl/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles/bin && zsh install.sh
```

**Ps.: `install.sh` script is idempotent, you can run how many times you want**




## Next steps

- Add gitconfig on Dotfiles
- Improve `install.sh` to automatic download _oh-my-zsh_ framework and _zinit manager plugins_. 
- Create a `Brewfile` to homebrew take care of the installation of the main programs
